# Angular Todo App
 
## Overview
 
### What is this app for?
 
This is a Todo app. It helps users to keep track of any things that they have todo.
 
### What does it do?
 
This app will allow users to register and login. Once the users have done that, they'll be able to create items to add to their todo list. Once they've created their todo list, they'll be able to update the status of each item and even delete items!
 
### How does it work
 
This app uses JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users and keep them logged in. All the data is consumed from an API hosted on Heroku using AngularJS. The site is styled with Bootstrap.
